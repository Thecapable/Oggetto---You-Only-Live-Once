# Oggetto-You Only Live Once

This project intends to identify objects in a frame, be it a real-time video or an image. After detection, the results are shown in the form of bounding boxes along with the name of the object and also audio output which also speaks out names of all the objects in the image. We'll use YOLO pre-trained model for detection of objects as it has been already trained on a large dataset containing various classes of objects, and hence, makes our job less time-taking.
